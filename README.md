# Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/outerbounds/hamilton-metaflow.git
cd ./absenteeism
```

This flow depends on Metaflow's integration with Anaconda. You can [install conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html#installation) like: 
```
bash Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.sh
```

## Note about visualizing Hamilton flow
In the `flow.py` step called `featurize_and_split` the code is configured to visualize the hamilton DAG.
To run this you need to have graphviz on your system PATH. 
A recommended approach is to [install graphviz at system level](https://graphviz.org/download/). 
* On MacOS: `brew install graphviz`
* On Unix: `sudo apt-get install graphviz`
* More alternatives are discussed [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35064304/runtimeerror-make-sure-the-graphviz-executables-are-on-your-systems-path-aft).

# Run the flow
Run the flow:
```
python ./flow.py --environment=conda run
```

Note that after configuring AWS credentials you can run any steps on AWS Batch using Metaflows `@batch` decorator. You can configure AWS credentials by following the prompts after:
```
aws configure
```

# Inspecting Results
This flow creates several Metaflow [cards](https://docs.metaflow.org/metaflow/visualizing-results/effortless-task-inspection-with-default-cards). Cards are associated with flow steps. These can be viewed locally in the browser by running 
```
python ./flow.py card view <step name>
```

For example, the `start` step displays class label distribution plots:
```
python ./flow.py card view start
```

You can see Hamilton visualizations by using
```
python ./flow.py card view featurize_and_split
python ./flow.py card view feature_importance_merge
```

You can also look at the scores of each modeling step in a pandas DataFrame like: 
``` python 
from metaflow import Flow
run = Flow('FeatureSelectionAndClassification').latest_run
run.data.results
```
