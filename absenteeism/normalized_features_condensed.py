"""
This modules shows a "super user" way to write the same features found in normalized_features.py.
It utilizes some Hamilton function decorators to write less code that is more dense.

Why might you use this approach?

- you and the people going to be reading your code are quite familiar with python.
- e.g. you understand python comprehensions & what ** does.
- you want less code to manage and less to update when things change.

What is the cost?

- it's less obvious to a new user to the code base, how a particular feature was produced.
- it's a little harder to map & debug outputs to where the code lives which defines that output.

So you should determine whether writing feature like this is right for you, depending on 
your environment (who is going to own & modify the code after you write it!). Our suggestions is to 
compare this file with normalized_features.py and ask yourself which one would you rather maintain?
